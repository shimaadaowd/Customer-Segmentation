# About:
This project is based on customer segmentation analysis for a customer database. Starting with exploring the data, then segmenting the customers according to the following segments:

- Champions: Those are the most spending customers (top customers).
- Loyal Customers: Those are the regular customers with medium to high buying rates.
- Potential Customers: Those are new buyers who can be potentially a regular customer.
- Recent Customers: Those are the latest buyers among our regular customers
- Customers at risk: Those are the customers who have been visiting or buying in a very little rates, and hence will be needing some attention to gain them back to their normal rates.
- Hibernating: Those are the customers who used to be loyal and haven't been buying for some time now.
- Lost: Those are the customers who used to be regulars but stopped buying and hence we lost them and need to gain them back.
